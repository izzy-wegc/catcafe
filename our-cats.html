                    <p>Meet Joy, a gentle soul with moonlight colored fur and eyes that could melt any heart. She's soft spoken, observant, and always a little curious watching the world quietly from her favorite fluffy blanket.</p>
                    <p>Joy loves soft head pats, cozy naps in sunbeams, and sitting just close enough to remind you she's there. She's a little shy at first, but once she trusts you, she'll be your calm and constant companion. She's looking for a peaceful, patient home full of love (and maybe a few treats).</p>

                    <p>Meet Edie, a golden girl with big eyes, a soft heart, and just the right amount of cattitude. She's confident, calm, and carries herself like she's been running the café since day one.</p>
                    <p>She's affectionate once she gets to know you—offering gentle head bumps and slow blinks to those lucky enough to be in her circle. She's not clingy, but she does enjoy good company (especially if it comes with treats). Looking for a relaxed home where she can be both admired and adored.</p>
